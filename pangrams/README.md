### Definitions
- **Anagram**: A rearrangement of the letters of a word or phrase, yielding another.
- **Heterogram**: A word or phrase with no repeated letters.
- **Pangram**: A phrase or set of words containing all letters of some alphabet (A-Z for us).
- **Perfect anagram**: A rearrangement of the letters of a word or phrase, yielding another, using the same number of repeated letters as the original.
- **Perfect pangram**: A phrase or set of words containing all letters of some alphabet EXACTLY once each.

"Anagram" is most often used to mean "perfect anagram."  In my code and discussion "anagram" means: "formed from the same set of letters without regard to repeats" which may also be called an imperfect anagram.

The word "set" is herein used exclusively in the formal sense, where each element in a set is distinct by definition: no element can be repeated in a set.

For example: `AALII` and `ILIAL` are both formed from the letter set `{A,I,L}` and are therefore anagrams of each other. But they are certainly imperfect anagrams, since `AALII` repeats the `A` while `ILIAL` repeats the `L`.

Similarly, perfect pangrams contain each letter of the target alphabet exactly once, while regular pangrams contain all the alphabet letters, but some may be repeated: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is 35 letters, with several repeated. "Mr Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx" is a perfect pangram over A-Z in English, albeit with use of abbreviations.

In any further discussion the "imperfect" qualifier is implicit.

### Known Wordleable Pangrams

#### Pangrams Generated from 25-letter Heterograms
One way to find pangrams that can be played in Wordle is to combine one of the twenty-five known five-word, twenty-five letter Wordleable heterograms (abbreviated "h-grams" below) listed at https://rentry.co/W5W25L742 with a Wordleable word containing the twenty-sixth letter that transforms that heterogram into a pangram.

##### Winning Wordle With a Pangram
This leads to what is probably the best way to play a pangram in Wordle and still win the game without knowing the answer in advance. The first instance of this known to the author was recorded in this play by @WT: https://nyti.ms/3Hf10eR#permid=130444396 that used the one "missing G" h-gram `CROMB JIVED KLUTZ PHYNX WAQFS` on Wordle `0939 DOING` to complete the pangram win (on the seventh day of trying: some luck required!).

@WT devised a clever method to increase the odds of winning with a pangram by playing the three words first that are in common with an h-gram that omits `V`: `CROMB`, `WAQFS` and `PHYNX`. `V` gives the second-best chance to get a pangram play, appearing in 148 Solutions (6%) compared to `G` which appears in 299 Solutions (13%). See https://rentry.co/wordle-letter-freq for more details about letter frequencies in Wordle Solutions.

After playing `CROMB`, `WAQFS` and `PHYNX`, you must commit to guessing whether the Solution for that day contains a `G` or a `V`. If you think the Solution contains a `V` you continue with `GLITZ` and `JUKED`. If you think the Solution contains a `G` then continue with `JIVED` and `KLUTZ`. (And if you are sure the solution contains neither `G` nor `V` you might as well solve it as quickly as you can: you're not getting a pangram win on that day!)

@WT's method increases the odds of winning with a pangram from a 13% chance each day (neglecting the effect of previously-used Solutions aka PU/PS) to nearly a 19% chance (taking into account the 15 Solutions that contain both a `G` and a `V`). Pretty good odds, and 100% effective for a skilled and patient player such as @WT is!

In fact, I've simplified @WT's actual method above: they were also thinking about a possible `J` solution using the heterogram `CROMB GIVED KLUTZ PHYNX WAQFS` which shares `KLUTZ` with the missing-`G` h-gram. So if you play `CROMB`, `WAQFS`, `PHYNX`, and `KLUTZ` you still keep the possibility of solving with a pangram if the answer contains a `J` by playing `GIVED` fifth instead of `JIVED`. This ups the daily odds by another percent to about a 20% chance per day that you attempt to win with a pangram.

The decision tree during play looks like this:

```text
Step 1:  \\ 

Step 2:   | - play CROMB, WAQFS, PHYNX in any order you prefer
Step 3:	 /

At this point (or earlier) if you're sure the solution doesn't contain G, J, or V
you should solve it and try again another day. But if you think it might contain
one of those letters, then continue with the decisions shown inside [..] below.

       [Decide: Do you think the solution contains a V?]
            |                                    |
       no V = G or J path                  yes V = V path
            |                                    |
Step 4: Play KLUTZ                           Play GLITZ or JUKED (i.e. commit to V path or solve).
            |                                Then on step 5 play the other one, or solve if the
   [Does the solution contain a J?]          solution doesn't turn out to contain a V.
            |                   |
       no J = G path      yes J = J path
            |                   |
Step 5: Play JIVED          Play GIVED
          or solve (if solution doesn't contain G or J)

Step 6: Solve and collect your pangram win, or hope for better luck tomorrow!
```

Finally, if you do win Wordle with a pangram by any method, be sure to get a screen capture of your completed game showing ALL the letters of the keyboard have changed color. This is half the fun of winning with a pangram, so save that screen capture to share later with other Wordle players.

##### Total Number of Pangrams Generated from Heterograms
There is:
- 1 h-gram missing the letter `G`
  + Combined with 1,748 Wordleable words containing `G` for 1,748 possible pangrams

There are:
- 8 h-grams missing the letter `J`
  + Combined with 340 Wordleable words containing `J` for 2,720 possible pangrams
- 5 h-grams missing the letter `Q`
  + Combined with 143 Wordleable words containing `Q` for 715 possible pangrams
- 5 h-grams missing the letter `V`
  + Combined with 773 Wordleable words containing `V` for 3,865 possible pangrams
- 6 h-grams missing the letter `X`
  + Combined with 325 Wordleable words containing `X` for 1,950 possible pangrams

For a total of (1,748 + 2,720 + 715 + 3,865 + 1,950) = **10,998 Wordleable pangrams** that can be generated from the known h-grams.

#### Pangrams Found by Exhaustive Search

See https://tinyurl.com/5n8s2kam

The first implementation of the exhaustive search in Python was agonizingly slow and would have required years, possibly decades, of runtime on my current laptop to complete the search. 

I have implemented a basic version of the exhaustive search in C that already runs about 60 times faster than the Python searcher. This program does not yet include optimizations based on previous work with heterograms.

Results and code are published under the MIT License, available via the URL above.

The search program is now running on eleven computers. Current search status is: L-Z are complete. A, B, E, G, I, J, and K are in progress. 282,919 "base" pangrams (without expanding anagrams) have been found. With anagrams expanded, the total known pangrams is 418,444.

6,232 of 14,855 valid guesses appear in the known pangrams (42%), and 1024 of 2313 known solutions (44%).
